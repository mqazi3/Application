Dear Hiring Committee,

I attached my code samples here, to view and download if needed. I attached three samples. One is in Python, while the other two are in Java.
The one in Python is for a Discord Music Bot, while the ones for Java are for a GUI that displays a loan calculator, and a game that allows someone to run Blackjack.

I attached screenshots of the ones in Java to display their results when running the code, along with Word documents that explain the process of creating the code and the strategies.

I wish to thank everyone for their time and consideration regarding my application.

Sincerely,

Muhammad Qazi
